# roulette
#reason I made this
I wanted to make something by using canvas.
#problems

1. It was hard to stop the roulette.
2. Hard to make Fan shape


#solution
1. 
I controled the speed of roulette by slowing down the speed of writing the fan shape.
Since I used this method it looks it is not moving, however it was moving a little.
So as a solution I stopped rewriting the figure when the speed of rewriting becomes lower than a certain number.

2. 
It was hard to write fan shape and make the figure move.
I managed to solve this problem by using trigonometric function.
